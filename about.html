            <p>
                Hello! My name is **Harusumi Takesada**. I am currently a freshman at NJIT, majoring in Business and Information Systems (BIS). I created Soccer Joy to share the passion and fundamental knowledge I've gained over many years of playing the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey with soccer began when I was six years old in Japan. Since then, soccer has been a core part of my life, teaching me the importance of teamwork, dedication, and precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is dedicated to giving young players the tools they need to experience the joy of improvement.
            </p>
